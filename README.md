### Hi there 👋😁

My name is Douglas Pinheiro, from Brazil (🇧🇷). Study Front-end and mobile development. I seek an opportunity to learn and work on these technologies. I am passionate about projects like Linux, so I always install a new distro! My goal is to work with Front-end and Mobile and support my wife and daughter doing what I love about technology.

In my free time, I enjoy studying the Bible (📓), spending time with my family (👨‍👨‍👧) reading good books (📚), watching movies (🎞️) and series (📺), listening to music (🎵) and eventually have a barbecue like that! (🥩).

Would you like to find me? 🚀🚀🚀
