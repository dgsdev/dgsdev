### Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Douglas Pinheiro, from Brazil (🇧🇷). I study Full Stack and mobile development. I always look for opportunities to learn and work with these technologies. I am passionate about projects like Linux, so I always install a new distro! My goal is to work with Full Stack and Mobile Development and support my wife and daughter doing what I love about technology.💙

Feel free to get in touch! 🚀
